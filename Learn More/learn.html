                    <li><span>Cost Savings:</span> Although hiring a haulage and relocating company involves a fee, it

                        support
                        to consumers
                        throughout the rental process. They can address any concerns or issues that arise during the
                        tenancy, such as maintenance requests, disputes with landlords, or lease renewals.</li>
                    <li><span>Market Insights:</span> Renting agents stay up to date with market trends, rental
                        regulations,
